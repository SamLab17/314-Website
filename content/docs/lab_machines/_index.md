# The CS Department Lab Machines

This contains a guide for connecting to and using the CS department Linux machines.

Learning how to connect to and use the lab machines will be extremely important for CS314 and
your future CS classes. In 314, the TAs will be compiling and running your code on the lab
machines. Therefore, it is _your responsibility_ to make sure your code runs as intended
on the lab machines. **We do not grade your code based on how it ran on your personal machine.**

Getting started with using the Lab machines can actually be a tricky process if this is
your first time working with SSH and Linux. Try to set aside some time early in the semester
to go through this process and make sure to get help if you ever get stuck! There are 
plenty of resources online at your disposal and you can also reach out to one of your TAs.
