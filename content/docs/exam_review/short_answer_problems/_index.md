# Short Answer Problems 

This is a collection of some short-answer questions I've written for CS 314.

If you believe a provided solution is wrong, let me know!

**Disclaimer:** These study materials are meant to be _supplementary_ to the
study materials Mike provides on his site. I've written these problems to be as
similar as possible to the kinds of problems you could see on an exam, but
looking at the past exams will always be more representative of what you can
expect to see on future exams.
